    "Hannah: Honestly, I do not have any experience with Pittsburgh neighborhoods. I've been living on campus, so I only know a very small amount of information about Oakland. I hadn't even heard of most of the neighborhoods I was gathering data on, but I have been through Squirrel Hill South on a bus before. It looks nice enough, and as far as our data shows, it proves to be the best neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. "
