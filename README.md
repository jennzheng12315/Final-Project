## TL:DR
Through a rating system, we found that Squirrel Hill South was the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. To find this, we looked at the total number of playgrounds, total number of works of public art, and number of traffic signs in each neighborhood. We decided to make these into a combined metric about which neighborhood was the most entertaining and safe for children. From the datasets, we gave each neighborhood a rating out of ten and found the average rating for each neighborhood. This showed Squirrel Hill South as having the highest average rating of 9.42.
