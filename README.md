## TL:DR
Through a rating system, we found that Squirrel Hill South was the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. To find this, we looked at the total number of playgrounds, total number of works of public art, and the median death age of each neighborhood. From there, we gave each neighborhood a rating and found the average rating for each neighborhood. This showed Squirrel Hill South as having the highest rating.
